# Open Epistemic Network Governance Charter

## 1. Purpose and Mission

The Open Epistemic Network is a decentralized knowledge validation and governance system designed to:

1. Provide a neutral, transparent platform for evaluating claims and knowledge
2. Promote diversity of perspectives and reduce systemic biases
3. Reward accuracy and honesty through a stake+reputation system
4. Enable decentralized governance of network parameters and rules
5. Ensure the network remains resilient, scalable, and future-proof

## 2. Governance Structure

### 2.1. Governance Body

The network is governed through a combination of:

1. **Validator Community**: All registered validators with stake in the network
2. **Governance Council**: A rotating council of experienced validators elected by the community
3. **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**: Technical experts responsible for core protocol development

### 2.2. Voting Mechanism

- **Proposal Voting**: Validators vote on governance proposals using their influence weight
- **Consensus Threshold**: Proposals require a minimum approval rate to be accepted
- **Voting Period**: Proposals are open for voting for 7 days
- **Delayed Activation**: Accepted proposals are activated after a 24-hour delay to allow for preparation

## 3. Governance Parameters

Key governance parameters that can be updated through proposals:

### 3.1. Stake and Reputation

- `min_stake`: Minimum stake required for validator registration
- `stake_decay_rate`: Rate at which stake decays over time
- `slash_amount`: Amount of stake slashed for incorrect votes
- `reputation_decay_rate`: Rate at which reputation decays
- `correct_vote_reward`: Reputation reward for correct votes
- `incorrect_vote_penalty`: Reputation penalty for incorrect votes

### 3.2. Validation Process

- `validation_rounds`: Number of validation rounds per claim
- `validators_per_round`: Number of validators sampled per round
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence required to reach consensus
- `voting_window`: Time window for submitting votes
- `diversity_weight`: Weight given to diversity in validator selection

### 3.3. Governance Process

- `proposal_activation_delay`: Delay between proposal acceptance and activation
- `voting_period`: Duration of voting phase
- `proposal_threshold`: Minimum influence required to submit proposals
- `quorum_requirement`: Minimum participation required for votes to be valid

## 4. Governance Process

### 4.1. Proposal Creation

1. **Idea Submission**: Anyone can submit a proposal idea for discussion
2. **Discussion Phase**: Community discussion and refinement of the proposal
3. **Formal Proposal**: A formal proposal with detailed specifications is created
4. **Technical Review**: TSC reviews the proposal for technical feasibility
5. **Voting Phase**: Validators vote on the proposal

### 4.2. Proposal Acceptance Criteria

For a proposal to be accepted:

1. Minimum participation of 30% of total influence weight
2. Minimum approval rate of 60% of participating influence
3. Maximum rejection rate of 30% of participating influence

### 4.3. Emergency Procedures

For critical security or operational issues:

1. **Emergency Activation**: Council members can activate emergency procedures
2. **Rapid Response**: Emergency proposals can be approved with 24-hour voting
3. **Temporary Measures**: Emergency measures are automatically rolled back after 30 days unless extended

## 5. Forking Process

If governance consensus cannot be reached or the network faces existential threats:

1. **Fork Declaration**: Any validator can declare a fork of the network
2. **State Export**: Current network state is exported for the new chain
3. **Fork Coordination**: Validators coordinate to establish the new network
4. **User Choice**: Users decide which chain to follow

## 6. Amendments to This Charter

This governance charter can be amended through the standard proposal process:

1. A proposal to amend the charter must include the complete revised charter
2. The proposal must receive a supermajority (80% approval) to be accepted
3. All changes must be clearly documented in the proposal

## 7. Dispute Resolution

Disputes regarding governance decisions are resolved through:

1. **Technical Arbitration**: TSC decides on technical disputes
2. **Governance Arbitration**: Council decides on procedural disputes
3. **Community Appeal**: Final appeal to the entire validator community

## 8. Transparency and Auditability

- All governance proposals and votes are recorded on the blockchain
- Proposal discussions are public and archived
- Validator behavior is audited periodically
- Audit reports are published and subject to community review

## 9. Code of Conduct

All participants must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Transparency**: Be open about your interests and motivations
2. **Respect**: Treat all participants with respect and dignity
3. **Honesty**: Provide accurate information and disclose conflicts of interest
4. **Collaboration**: Work towards consensus and common goals
5. **Accountability**: Take responsibility for your actions and decisions
