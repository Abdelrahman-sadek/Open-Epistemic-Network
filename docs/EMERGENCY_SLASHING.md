# Emergency Slashing Procedure Playbook

## Purpose

This playbook outlines the procedure for emergency slashing of validators in response to critical security incidents or malicious behavior.

## 1. Incident Classification

### 1.1. Severity Levels

- **Critical (Level 1)**:
  - Validator behavior threatens network security
  - Evidence of intentional manipulation or attack
  - High potential for significant damage

- **Serious (Level 2)**:
  - Repeated incorrect voting patterns
  - Pattern of low confidence or uncertain votes
  - Non-compliance with network rules

- **Warning (Level 3)**:
  - Single instance of high-confidence incorrect vote
  - Minor discrepancies in behavior
  - First offense

## 2. Slashing Triggers

### 2.1. Automatic Slashing

The network automatically applies slashing for:

1. **Incorrect Votes**: Validators are automatically slashed for high-confidence incorrect votes
2. **Consistent Incorrectness**: Pattern of repeated incorrect voting within a short period
3. **Suspicious Behavior**: Unusual voting patterns that suggest manipulation

### 2.2. Manual Slashing

Emergency manual slashing can be triggered by:

1. **Governance Council Decision**: 60% of council members must approve
2. **TSC Recommendation**: Technical committee identifies security threat
3. **Community Vote**: Validator community votes to apply emergency slashing

## 3. Emergency Slashing Process

### 3.1. Incident Detection

1. **Monitoring System Alerts**: Automated systems detect suspicious behavior
2. **Human Review**: Security team and validators investigate alerts
3. **Evidence Collection**: Gather evidence of malicious or harmful behavior
4. **Verification**: Multiple independent validators confirm the incident

### 3.2. Response Team Assembly

1. **Lead Responder**: Assigned by Governance Council
2. **Security Team**: TSC members with security expertise
3. **Validator Representatives**: 3-5 experienced validators
4. **Communications Team**: Handles public communication

### 3.3. Slashing Decision

1. **Evidence Review**: Complete audit of the incident
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential damage
3. **Decision Making**: Council members vote on slashing action
4. **Documentation**: Full record of decision and rationale

### 3.4. Slashing Execution

1. **Slash Amount Calculation**: Determined by severity and impact
2. **Execution**: Network automatically applies the slash
3. **Notification**: Validator and community are informed
4. **Monitoring**: Track effect of slashing on network security

## 4. Slash Amount Guidelines

### 4.1. Critical Incidents (20-50% Slash)

- Intentional attack or manipulation
- Coordinated attempt to compromise network security
- Significant potential damage

### 4.2. Serious Incidents (10-20% Slash)

- Repeated incorrect voting patterns
- Consistent non-compliance
- Pattern of suspicious behavior

### 4.3. Warning Level (1-10% Slash)

- First offense minor violations
- Single instance of incorrect voting
- Minor rule violations

## 5. Recovery and Appeal Process

### 5.1. Validator Recovery

1. **Appeal Period**: Validator has 3 days to appeal
2. **Documentation Review**: Evidence is re-examined
3. **Community Vote**: Validators vote on appeal
4. **Resolution**: Decision is made and executed

### 5.2. Network Recovery

1. **Monitoring**: Track network behavior post-slashing
2. **Security Enhancement**: Implement measures to prevent recurrence
3. **Community Engagement**: Address concerns and communicate improvements
4. **Documentation**: Update processes based on lessons learned

## 6. Communication Protocol

### 6.1. Internal Communication

- Council members communicate via encrypted channels
- Security team uses secure communication tools
- Regular update calls with stakeholders

### 6.2. External Communication

- Public statement within 4 hours of decision
- Detailed incident report within 24 hours
- Regular updates during investigation
- Post-incident report within 7 days

### 6.3. Key Messaging

- Transparent and factual information
- Clearly state the problem and response
- Outline steps taken and future prevention measures
- Address community concerns

## 7. Prevention and Mitigation

### 7.1. Proactive Measures

1. **Regular Audits**: Quarterly security audits
2. **Incident Simulation**: Regular emergency scenario drills
3. **Validator Education**: Training on security best practices
4. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Improve detection systems

### 7.2. Post-Incident Improvements

1. **Process Review**: Update procedures based on incident
2. **System Enhancement**: Improve network security
3. **Policy Updates**: Modify governance rules if needed
4. **Documentation**: Update playbooks and guidelines

## 8. Contact Information

### 8.1. Emergency Contacts

- **Governance Council Lead**: council@openepistemic.network
- **TSC Security Team**: security@openepistemic.network
- **Emergency Hotline**: +1-555-OPEN-123 (24/7)

### 8.2. Reporting Incidents

- **Email**: incidents@openepistemic.network

## 9. Documentation and Records

1. **Incident Logs**: Complete records of all incidents
2. **Decision Records**: Voting records and rationale
3. **Recovery Reports**: Post-incident analysis
4. **Lessons Learned**: Process improvements identified

All records are maintained for at least 5 years and made available to the community for review.
